// return & Early Return -->

// Return means jaha se aaya hai wahi daal do...
  // In react we return all the html base code because we want to that when we call those   component or those function so all the html base code is called which means jaha se call hua hai wahi daal diya..


// Early return means returing in same line...

// Example-->
    // if(messi === "goat") return "He is always a goat";
